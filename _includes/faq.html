                    What should I expect during a Kambô ceremony?

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2 pt-2 border-t">Kambô is a powerful cleansing medicine that works primarily on the physical and energetic body. During the ceremony, small points are burned on the skin and the frog secretion is applied. You may experience nausea, purging, increased heart rate, and a feeling of heat. This process typically lasts 15-45 minutes and is followed by a deep sense of clarity and well-being.</p>

                    Why is the dieta important?
                    <span class="text-blue-600">+</span>
                </h3>
                <div>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2 pt-2 border-t">The dieta is a crucial part of the preparation. It involves abstaining from certain foods (like red meat, pork, spicy food, salt, sugar, and fermented foods) and activities to purify your body and mind. This allows the medicines to work more deeply and effectively, and shows your respect and commitment to the process.</p>
